# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
## Overview
This data analysis project investigates the high cancellation rates in hotel bookings despite strong reservation numbers. Using Python and data visualization tools, I uncovered key patterns behind cancellations and provided actionable solutions to improve retention.

## Tools Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Findings  
1. **65% cancellations came from online bookings**  
   - Reason: Misleading room photos (reality vs. online ads mismatch)  
2. **Discounted bookings had 2x higher cancellation rates**  
3. **Peak season = More bookings BUT more cancellations**  

##  Recommendations  
- Show **real, unedited room photos/videos** online  
- Offer **free 24-hour cancellation** to build trust  
- Avoid excessive discounts for early bookings
